                seeking tracks for a compilation. With an immediate
                connection, the pair decided to try their hand at
                making a song. That’s when they created their
                breakout single, We Are Your Friends – a feel-good,
                funk-filled, instant anthem that lost the remix
                contest, but won the attention of Pedro Winter,
                director of the newly founded Ed Banger Records,
                who boasted Daft Punk as former clients. One week
                later, they were in his office, signing a record deal.
